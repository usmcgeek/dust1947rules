Each game of Dust 1947 simulates a complete battle. Players alternate Activating Units until the game is complete. During an Activation, Units can Move, Attack other Units, use Special Skills, or do nothing. To determine the success or failure of Actions, such as Attacks, hiding behind cover, and using Special Skills, players roll special dice called "Dust Dice."
